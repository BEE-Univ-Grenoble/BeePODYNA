#' 'mat-interaction' creates an interactions matrix object
#'
#' Creates an interactions matrix object defining the positive and negative interactions between populations.
#' The interaction is not assumed symetrical, so a population can have a different effect on a population than this latest has on the first one.
#' The interaction of a population on itself is equal to 0.
#'
#' @param nb_pop is the number of populations in the model.
#' @param interactions is a vector of length nb_pop*(nb_pop-1) giving the interaction of each population on the other one.
#' Each interaction is a decimal ranging between -1 and 1. A positive value means a positive impact (facilitation) while a negative value means a negative impact (predation, competition).
#' The vector starts with the vector of the interactions of the first population on the other ones (ranging from 2 to the last one, not including itself),
#' and then the vector of the interactions of the second population on the others...
#'
#' @examples
#'   mat_interaction(nb_pop=3, interactions=c(0.2,-0.5, 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.8))
